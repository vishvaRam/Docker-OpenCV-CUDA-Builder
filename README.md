# OpenCV with CUDA Docker Setup

This project provides a Docker-based environment for running OpenCV with CUDA support, enabling GPU-accelerated computer vision tasks. The setup includes a complete build of OpenCV 4.10.0 with CUDA 12.6.3 and cuDNN support.

## Features

- OpenCV 4.10.0 with CUDA support
- CUDA 12.6.3 with cuDNN
- GPU-accelerated image processing
- Pre-configured Docker environment
- Example code demonstrating CUDA-enabled OpenCV operations

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- Docker Compose

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
```

2. Ensure you have the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed:


## Usage

1. Build and run the container using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. The example code will:
   - Check for CUDA availability
   - Create a random test image
   - Apply GPU-accelerated Gaussian blur
   - Save both original and processed images
